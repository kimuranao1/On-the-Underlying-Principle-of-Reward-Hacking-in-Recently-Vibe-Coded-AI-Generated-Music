On the Underlying Principle of Reward Hacking in Recently Vibe-Coded AI-Generated Music
</div>

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>Lately, with AI getting so big, people keep saying stuff like, “Music made by AI is just empty but super high-quality reward hacking, and that’s what’s popular now.” I’ve listened to some AI music myself, and honestly? It <em>is</em> incredibly moving. It’s exciting. It really is amazing. So I get why people are shocked by it, or even a little scared of it. I’ve even heard stories about artists going quiet, and people overseas posting weird comments like, “They sold their souls to black magic.”</p>

<p>But is that really true? Has AI actually reached some terrifying, supernatural level?</p>

<p>Personally, after about ten years obsessing over the theory of composition, I don’t think that’s what’s going on at all. It’s not magic. It’s not some mystical data spell. It’s just something new, unfamiliar, and hardly anyone has actually talked about it seriously yet. That’s all.</p>

<p>What I mean is this: music theory can already explain these things. The reason people think it’s mysterious is because almost nobody has really explored this area deeply. And the reason nobody has explored it is simple — nobody realized it was valuable.</p>

<p>At first glance, this kind of information looks useless. Like garbage. But if you actually master the theory behind it, then “reward hacking” in music becomes ridiculously easy. Think about all those hit songs out there. Don’t you think they must have something in common?</p>

<p>So how do you extract that common element? Do you need AI to do it? I don’t think so. It’s about learning to see what you normally can’t see.</p>

<p>For example, say you see the notes “Do Re Mi” written on paper. What do most people do? They just think, “Oh, that’s Do Re Mi,” and stop there. And if it’s from a hit song, they might copy it and repeat Do Re Mi. But that’s not application — that’s just imitation.</p>

<p>The real question is: what <strong>isn’t</strong> visible there?</p>

<p>How far apart are those notes? Is it root → major second up → another major second up? Or something else? Does “Re-Mi” feel the same when it comes after “Do” versus when it appears alone? What key was it in? What chord progression was underneath? What effect did that harmony have on the melody? What rhythm were the notes played in? Staccato? Legato? What velocity? What lyrics were sung? What meaning did the melody carry in context?</p>

<p>None of that information is written in the simple label “Do Re Mi.” But those hidden details are exactly what define the music.</p>

<p>Humans have mostly ignored that kind of observation. We just see “Do Re Mi” and call it “Do Re Mi.” So when a hit song uses it, we copy it literally — and that’s it. No abstraction, no analysis.</p>

<p>But suppose you actually analyze it and realize it’s “root → up major second → up major second.” Then if your new piece is in D as the root, you could generate “Re Mi Fa#.” That’s a true structural reuse.</p>

<p>Or suppose your analysis shows it’s really “root → up fifth → up second → up second.” Then applying that to D would give you something like “So La Si.” See? The application changes depending on what you <em>actually analyzed</em>.</p>

<p>Same thing with rhythm. If Do-Re-Mi was played as eighth, eighth, sixteenth notes, nobody’s going to notice if you reuse that rhythm somewhere else. You could pair it with totally different pitches — Fa-Do-Fa, a children’s tune, whatever — and it still works structurally.</p>

<p>Or imagine a hit song where the lyric “Die” was sung over Do-Re-Mi. If someone later released a song singing “Live” over the same melodic structure, that could function as a powerful contrast piece. That’s not copying — that’s reinterpretation.</p>

<p>And if simple note-spacing patterns like Do-Re-Mi are popular, you could reuse that same spacing over and over across a song — Re-Mi-Fa#, Mi-Fa#-So#, and so on — making everything sound fresh while actually using the same underlying rule. Listeners wouldn’t even notice.</p>

<p>And this doesn’t just apply to melody. The exact same logic applies to:</p>

<ul>
<li>chord progressions</li>
<li>rhythmic patterns</li>
<li>harmonic motion</li>
<li>tonal distance</li>
<li>modulation behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically anything musical.</p>

<p>The truth is, people haven’t really analyzed these things carefully. They haven’t observed what actually makes a song what it is. They just treat a hit song as popular <em>because it’s that song</em>, instead of extracting reusable structure from it.</p>

<p>So even though humans could have learned tons from past hit songs, they usually didn’t. Sometimes they were so lazy they just copied things outright, in ways anyone could spot. Honestly, that’s not AI defeating humans — that’s humans not doing the work.</p>

<p>Try analyzing even a single hit song deeply:</p>

<p>
How far apart are its melody intervals most of the time?<br>
What interval distances do <em>you</em> personally like?<br>
If you isolate just the rhythm, does it repeat?<br>
Did you fail to notice similarities because the pitches were different?<br>
How do the chords relate to each other?<br>
How far do they move — minor to major, major to minor, or something else?<br>
What context are they used in?<br>
How far above the root do they sit?<br>
Are they diatonic? Parallel? Non-diatonic?<br>
What happens if you transpose them into another key?
</p>

<p>It’s way too early to call something impossible or give up without even trying those analyses.</p>

<p><strong>Please — actually look.</strong></p>
